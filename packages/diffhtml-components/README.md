# <Â±/> diffHTML Components

*JavaScript classes for rendering components using either Custom Element or
React-inspired implementations.*

Stable Version: 1.0.0-beta.18

The exported classes `Component` and `WebComponent` are designed to be
inter-changeable and as close to feature-parity as possible. This helps bridge
the React / Web Component gap.

## Installation

``` sh
npm install --save diffhtml-components
```

## Getting started

Before you can use this module, you will need to have diffHTML loaded first.
This component simply provides the `Component` and `WebComponent` classes, and
respective middleware, which help you create Virtual Trees to structure your
code.

You can create components as easy as:

``` js
import { html, innerHTML } from 'diffhtml';
import { Component, WebComponent } from 'diffhtml-components';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return html`
      <h1>Rendering a Web Component inside a React-Like Component:</h1>
      <web-component />
    `;
    //return (
    //  <span>Even Supports JSX (use Babel transform)!</span>
    //);
  }
}

// Only works if your browser supports the `customElements` global registry.
// Load a suitable polyfill if you really want to use these in production.
customElements.define('web-component', class extends WebComponent {
  render() {
    return html`
      <span>Custom Elements work just fine and 1:1 with React Components</span>
    `;
    //return (
    //  <span>Even Supports JSX (use Babel transform)!</span>
    //);
  }
});

innerHTML(document.body, html`<${MyComponent} />`);
```

## PropTypes

The PropTypes package has been extracted out of React into a standalone module
(`npm i prop-types`) which can be used with both `Component` and `WebComponent`
implementations.

**If you are using Web Components please note that PropTypes are required so
that the implementation knows which attributes to fire change events on.**

[See the MDN article on it for more
information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements#Observed_attributes)


Example using PropTypes with ES6:

``` js
import { html } from 'diffhtml';
import { Component } from 'diffhtml-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    const { className } = this.props;

    return html`
      <div class=${className}>${label}</div>
    `;
  }
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  className: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  label: PropTypes.string,
};
```

Using with `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties`:

``` js
import { html } from 'diffhtml';
import { Component } from 'diffhtml-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    const { className } = this.props;

    return html`
      <div class=${className}>${label}</div>
    `;
  }

  static propTypes = {
    className: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    label: PropTypes.string,
  }
}
```

Also note that in order to fully remove PropTypes from a bundler, you will need
to add additional configuration. Please consult the bundlers documentation for
this until we add examples.

## State

diffHTML Components are stateful and follow the React model of `setState`. By
default your components are given an empty `state` object that you can use to
store any kind of local state for your component. While you can edit this
object directly, this will not trigger any kind of component update. To set
the new state and trigger a re-render, you will need to use the `setState`
method.

For example:

``` js
import { html } from 'diffhtml';
import { Component } from 'diffhtml-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class SimpleCounter extends Component {
  render() {
    const {  } = this.props;

    return html`
      <div class=${className}>${label}</div>
    `;
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Increment the `tick` state every second.
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.setState({
      tick: ++this.state.tick,
    }), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }
}
```

The `setState` call receives the incoming object, which is merged into the
existing `this.state` and then into a brand new object, which effectively
causes your `state` property to be "immutable".

If you were to call `setState` in a tight loop, you would notice that the first
call would trigger a re-render, but would not render again until the tight
loop completes. This is a way to throttle while also allowing `setState` to be
reliable for synchronous operations.

If you do not like the behavior and wish to have more control over setting
state and rendering changes, look into `forceUpdate` below.

## Force Update

The `forceUpdate()` method is implemented and will trigger a no-questions-asked
-render of your component. This is a synchronous operation, but if diffHTML
has a paused transaction, this will wait until the existing transaction has
completed before modifying your component.

This is especially useful if you want to manage state outside of `setState` and
want your components to be reactive.

## Examples

The following examples show what real-world usage of these components may look
like.

### React Like

Useful when you need minimal React features for new projects. This is not
necessarily a good package for React Compatibility inter-op, although it can
work to load some components. If you need full parity with React, look to the
[`diffhtml-react-compat`](../packages/diffhtml-react-compat).

``` js
import { html, innerHTML } from 'diffhtml';
import { Component } from 'diffhtml-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class SimpleClock extends Component {
  render() {
    const { now } = this.state;

    return html`
      <strong>The current unix timestamp is:</strong> ${now}
    `;
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { now: Date.now() };

    // Update very fast.
    setInterval(() => this.setState({ now: Date.now() }), 10);
  }
}

// Not-required, but nice to have for debugging purposes.
SimpleClock.propTypes = {
  now: PropTypes.number,
};

// Render to the `<body />` element.
innerHTML(document.body, html`<${SimpleClock} />`);
```


### Web Components

Will only work in browsers that support v1 Web Components specification. At the
moment this will in most stable browsers, with the exception of Internet
Explorer, which is current in development.

``` js
import { html, innerHTML } from 'diffhtml';
import { WebComponent } from 'diffhtml-components';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class SimpleClock extends WebComponent {
  render() {
    const { now } = this.state;

    return html`
      <strong>The current unix timestamp is:</strong> ${now}
    `;
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { now: Date.now() };

    // Update very fast.
    setInterval(() => this.setState({ now: Date.now() }), 10);
  }
}

// Required to auto-fill the `observedAttributes` function.
SimpleClock.propTypes = {
  now: PropTypes.number,
};

// Register into the browser's element registry.
customElements.define('simple-clock', SimpleClock);

// Render to the `<body />` element.
innerHTML(document.body, html`<simple-clock />`);
```
